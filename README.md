# FastAPI-GraphQL
In this project my main goal was to do apply a project with GraphQL. I created a social media app with 6 entities. I used Alembic to do the database migrations. I used GraphQL instead of REST and applied basic CRUD operations. I used the best practices when designing a FastAPI project.
